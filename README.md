<h1>VibeGraam - Decentralized Social Media Platform Made for Generating Funds for charitable Organizations Made on Solana<h1>


<h2>Why it is Needed?<h2>
<h3>
The social Medial Platforms we have available today have a Severe issue of 
<br>
◉Trust
<br>
◉Data Manipulation
<br>
◉Data Breach
<br>
◉Centralization of Power of Data
<br>
◉Contributing Nothing Directly to the Charity
<br>
<h3>

We at Vibegraam Have aimed to Solve these issues , Since we have used Blockchain the Main 3 problems are Solved automatically
<br>
Data Manipulation 
<br>
Data breach
<br>
and Centralization of power
<br>

<br>
<h3>◈Problem with other Decentralized Social media Platforms<h3>
<br>
<h3>There have been other Decentralzied Social medial Platform , But most are made on Ethereum and That is much much slower and Expensive to work with
<br>

<br>
But! Not VibeGRaam since we Used SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN our Interface is Lighting fast compared to Other Decentralized Social Media
<br>
<br>
While Ethereum can only process 30 transactions per second, Solana can process 65,000 transactions per second. 
<br>
The block time of Ethereum is 15 seconds, whereas that of Solana is just one second.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Cost Effectiveness Of Vibegram<h2>
<br>
<h3>Solana has a fees that is 0.01 USD per transaction compared to other Platforms Made on Ethereum Which cost upto 14usd per transactions
<br>
Thus our Platform will attract more Users without them thinking about the expense that much
Which will in turn Help us in Generating revenue for Charitable Organization through the ad revenue Our platform Generates
<br>
<br>
50% of all the Revenue Generated will be made to automatically be sent to the Phantom wallets of Charitable organizations
<br>
And since all the data is saved on chain, there is no issue of anyone hindering with this process of 
<br>
50% funds being transferred to the Charitable oraganizations
<h3>

## How to Start Up the Platform Locally on your System 

First, run the development server:

```bash
1.yarn install

2.yarn build
```
To install All the needed dependendcies 

```bash
Now You need to Download Phantom Wallet as all the data is Saved on chain.

So you need some SOLANA or Solana Faucests to validate the transactions on chain.
For that You can get some Solana Faucets from the link given below.
```
Download Phantom Wallet=[https://phantom.app/download].


Get Solana Faucet = [https://solfaucet.com/].

```bash
3.yarn start
# or
yarn dev
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
